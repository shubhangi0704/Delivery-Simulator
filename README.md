# Delivery-Simulator
Delivery Simulator is a Python-based AI pathfinding project where a courier navigates real MP-inspired cities (Bhopal, Indore, Shivpuri, Jabalpur) using BFS, UCS, A*, and local search. With walls, terrain, and traffic dynamics, it helps compare algorithms in solving real-world deliveryÂ challenges.
